# Spotify-Prediction-whether-a-newly-uploaded-song-on-Spotify-will-make-to-be-a-hit-song-ML
Music is considered an art but have you ever thought of what happens probably behind the scenes to make it an art. May be it's the beats, energy, liveliness, and the ability to dance brought about by a tune. If all these factors work out right then a song is conisidered the most lively probably making it among the top hits. Using a spotify dataset we would like to know among which factors affect whether a song will be a hit song or not. Moreover, we will build a model that predicts whether a song will be a hit song based on the nature of it's beats, energy, danceablity, liveness, and loudness.
